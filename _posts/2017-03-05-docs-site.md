One of the common pieces of feedback we've had is that people don't really know what they're doing with Urn. Over the
last couple of days I've been working on a [series of tutorials][1] for Urn: explaining some of the language features,
introducing macros, and what not. Hopefully this make getting started with Urn a breeze.

However, that being said, getting documentation right is hard - especially if you are overly familiar with the language
already. If you do struggle to understand something it means the docs are failing! Drop me a line (through the forums,
GitHub, GitLab, Discord, Gitter, etc...) and I'd be happy to clarify things and fix the docs.

Many thanks to all those people who have given feedback on Urn so far. Go forth, and [try out the docs!][1]
