Another update to Urn, though just a minor one. We've been hard at work improving the speed of Urn, using faster
algorithms and generating better code. Due to a couple of nifty changes and optimisations, the Urn compiler is somewhere
between 30% and 50% faster.

For instance, building the entire Urn compiler (with inlining enabled) took about 3.8 seconds on the last release, but
now takes 2.4 seconds. It's worth noting that the Urn compiler is rather large by Lua standards (7k LOC - even Howl has
less than that): most of your programs will compile well within a second, even with all optimisations turned on.
