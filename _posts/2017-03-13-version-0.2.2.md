It's update time and oh boy: what an update!

## New CLI
First off, in our slow quest to make the Urn compiler self-hosting we've ported the Urn command line interface to
Urn. However, this wasn't just a boring old line-for-line port, the rewrite comes with a whole host of new options:

It uses Urn's new argument parser library meaning it can handle all standard argument formats, as well as providing more
informative help messages. This new CLI also offers finer control: allowing you to disable specific optimisations, add
shebangs to your files, automatically set the executable bit, etc...

## Contributions from other people
I'd like to say a big thanks to CrazedProgrammer and Lignum. CrazedProgrammer has sent a couple of PRs in, adding a
fancy `io` library for file manipulation, as well as several additions to the string library. Lignum has put together
a [bindings for ComputerCraft]("https://gitlab.com/Lignum/urn-computercraft-binding"), meaning you can use your
favourite APIs inside Urn. Check out the repo for more information and installation instructions.

## Other improvements
 - Add optional and type patterns to the pattern matcher.
 - Format bold and italic documentation in the REPL.
 - Add more granular system to monitor and control optimisation and analysis passes.
 - Optimise the optimiser.
