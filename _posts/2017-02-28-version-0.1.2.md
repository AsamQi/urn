I've just released another version of Urn, with some very groovy features:

Firstly we've started work on Urn's static analysis framework, which provides warnings for code which isn't technically
incorrect but shows you've probably made a mistake.

The bindings to Lua's core library have also been given an overhaul with two benefits. Firstly the preamble size has
been significantly reduced: from ~130 lines to 15. This means you now only have to see the code that you're interested
in. The other advantage of this is the ability to constant fold arbitrary native functions. For instance:

```cl
(print! (string/sub "foo bar!" 5))
```

is simplified to:

```lua
print_21_1("bar!")
```

as `string/sub` is considered a "pure" function.

I've also done a bit of work on [Urn's documentation site]("https://squiddev.github.io/urn/"). Whilst it is still
lacking tutorials, all libraries are documented there which should help you get started.
