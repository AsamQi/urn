It's a little earlier than normal, but it's still update time.

## New documentation
This isn't very exciting, but we've re-done [a fair bit of documentation]("https://squiddev.github.io/urn/"), adding
explanations on syntax and special forms, as well as more tutorials on Lua interop and the compiler API & plugin system.

## General recursion helper
demhydraz has been working on a whole range of improvements to the standard library. One of these is the new `loop`
construct. This makes it possible to define a tail-recursive construct without an explicit `letrec`: Instead of calling
yourself, you call recur. For instance, here is a naive way to reverse a list:

```cl
(loop [(o '())
       (l '(1 2 3))]
  [(empty? l) o]
  (recur (cons (car l) o) (cdr l)))
```
