I've just pushed another release of Urn.

Firstly, good news for Windows users. Urn will attempt to work out whether your terminal supports ANSI colours, only
using them if so. If your terminal is incorrectly detected, please create an issue
on [GitHub]("https://github.com/SquidDev/urn/issues/new") or [GitLab]("https://gitlab.com/SquidDev/urn/issues/new").
I've also worked in improving the optimiser. It now will correctly simplify variable accesses to their root
value. Something like:

```cl
(define x <compile_expr>)
(define y x)
(define z y)
(print! z)
```

will simplify to

```cl
(define x <compile_expr>)
(print! x)
```

You can see the result of this optimisation on [files like this][1].
