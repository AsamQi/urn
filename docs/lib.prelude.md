# prelude
## `(! expr)`
*Defined at lib/base.lisp:78:1*

Negate the expresison `EXPR`.

## `(# x)`
*Defined at lib/lua/basic.lisp:50:1*

Get the length of list X

## `(#keys st)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:104:1*

Return the number of keys in the structure `ST`.

## `#s`
*Defined at lib/string.lisp:17:1*

Return the length of the string `X`.

## `(-> x &funcs)`
*Macro defined at lib/function.lisp:59:1*

Chain a series of method calls together. If the list contains `<>`
then the value is placed there, otherwise the expression is invoked with
the previous entry as an argument.

### Example
```
> (-> '(1 2 3)
    succ
    (* <> 2))
(4 6 8)
```

## `(.. &args)`
*Defined at lib/string.lisp:13:1*

Concatenate the several values given in `ARGS`. They must all be strings.

## `(.<! x &keys value)`
*Macro defined at lib/table.lisp:66:1*

Set the value at `KEYS` in the structure `X` to `VALUE`.

## `(.> x &keys)`
*Macro defined at lib/table.lisp:60:1*

Index the structure `X` with the sequence of accesses given by `KEYS`.

## `(accumulate-with f ac z xs)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:344:1*

`A` composition of [`foldr`](lib.list.md#foldr-f-z-xs) and [`map`](lib.list.md#map-f-xs-acc)
Transform the values of `XS` using the function `F`, then accumulate them
starting form `Z` using the function `AC`.

This function behaves as if it were folding over the list `XS` with the
monoid described by (`F`, `AC`, `Z`), that is, `F` constructs the monoid, `AC`
is the binary operation, and `Z` is the zero element.

Example:
```
> (accumulate-with tonumber + 0 '(1 2 3 4 5))
15
```

## `(all p xs)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:156:1*

Test if all elements of `XS` match the predicate `P`.

Example:
```
> (all symbol? '(foo bar baz))
true
> (all number? '(1 2 foo))
false
```

## `(and a b &rest)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:129:1*

Return the logical and of values `A` and `B`, and, if present, the
logical and of all the values in `REST`.

## `(any p xs)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:143:1*

Check for the existence of an element in `XS` that matches the
predicate `P`.

Example:
```
> (any exists? '(nil 1 "foo"))
true
```

## `(append xs ys)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:294:1*

Concatenate `XS` and `YS`.

Example:
```
> (append '(1 2) '(3 4))
'(1 2 3 4)
``` 

## `arg`
*Defined at lib/base.lisp:179:1*

The arguments passed to the currently executing program

## `(assert-type! arg ty)`
*Macro defined at lib/type.lisp:131:1*

Assert that the argument `ARG` has type `TY`, as reported by the function
[`type`](lib.type.md#type-val).

## `(assoc list key or-val)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:10:1*

Return the value given by `KEY` in the association list `LIST`, or, in
the case that it does not exist, the value `OR`-`VAL`, which can be nil.

## `(assoc->struct list)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:35:1*

Convert the association list `LIST` into a structure. Much like [`assoc`](lib.table.md#assoc-list-key-or-val),
in the case there are several values bound to the same key, the first
value is chosen.

## `(assoc? list key)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:21:1*

Check that `KEY` is bound in the association list `LIST`.

## `(atom? x)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:44:1*

Check whether `X` is an atomic object, that is, one of
- `A` boolean
- `A` string
- `A` number
- `A` symbol
- `A` key
- `A` function

## `(between? val min max)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:69:1*

Check if the numerical value `X` is between
`MIN` and `MAX`.

## `bool->string`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:46:1*

Convert the boolean `X` into a string.

## `(boolean? x)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:32:1*

Check whether `X` is a boolean.

## `(car x)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:28:1*

Return the first element present in the list `X`. This function operates
in constant time.

Example:
```
> (car '(1 2 3))
1
```

## `(case val &pts)`
*Macro defined at lib/match.lisp:180:1*

Match a single value against a series of patterns, evaluating the first
body that matches, much like `cond`.

## `(cdr x)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:40:1*

Return the list `X` without the first element present. In the case that
`X` is nil, the empty list is returned. Due to the way lists are represented
internally, this function runs in linear time.

Example:
```
> (cdr '(1 2 3))
'(2 3)
```

## `(compose f g)`
*Defined at lib/function.lisp:100:1*

Return the pointwise composition of functions `F` and `G`. This corresponds to
the mathematical operator `âˆ˜`, i.e. `(compose f g)` corresponds to
`h(x) = f (g x)` (`(lambda (x) (f (g x)))`).

## `(cons x xs)`
*Defined at lib/base.lisp:51:1*

Add `X` to the start of the list `XS`. Note: this is linear in time.

## `(const x)`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:84:1*

Return a function which always returns `X`. This is equivalent to the `K`
combinator in `SK` combinator calculus.

## `(const-val val)`
*Defined at lib/base.lisp:191:1*

Get the actual value of `VAL`, an argument to a macro.

Due to how macros are implemented, all values are wrapped as tables
in order to preserve positional data about nodes. You will need to
unwrap them in order to use them.

## `(cut &func)`
*Macro defined at lib/function.lisp:16:1*

Partially apply a function `FUNC`, where each `<>` is replaced by an
argument to a function. Values are evaluated every time the resulting
function is called.

### Example
```
> (define double (cut * <> 2))
> (double 3)
6
```

## `(cute &func)`
*Macro defined at lib/function.lisp:37:1*

Partially apply a function `FUNC`, where each `<>` is replaced by an
argument to a function. Values are evaluated when this function is
defined.

### Example
```
> (define double (cute * <> 2))
> (double 3)
6
```

## `(debug x)`
*Defined at lib/base.lisp:151:1*

Print the value `X`, then return it unmodified.

## `(dec! x)`
*Macro defined at lib/prelude.lisp:32:1*

optional metadata at the start of `BODY`.

## `(destructuring-bind pt &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/match.lisp:164:1*

Match a single pattern against a single value, then evaluate the `BODY`.
The pattern is given as `(car PT)` and the value as `(cadr PT)`.
If the pattern does not match, an error is thrown.

## `(drop xs n)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:65:1*

Remove the first `N` elements of the list `XS`.

Example:
```
> (take '(1 2 3 4 5) 2)
'(3 4 5)
```

## `(elem? x xs)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:170:1*

Test if `X` is present in the list `XS`.

Example:
```
> (elem? 1 '(1 2 3))
true
> (elem? 'foo '(1 2 3))
false
```

## `empty-struct`
*Native defined at lib/lua/table.lisp:8:1*

Create an empty structure with no fields

## `(empty-struct? xs)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:100:1*

Check that `XS` is the empty struct.

## `(eq? x y)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:82:1*

Compare `X` and `Y` for equality deeply.
Rules:
- If `X` and `Y` exist, `X` and `Y` are equal if:
  - If `X` or `Y` are a symbol
    - Both are symbols, and their contents are equal.
    - `X` is a symbol, and `Y` is a string equal to the symbol's contents.
    - `Y` is a symbol, and `X` is a string equal to the symbol's contents.
  - If `X` or `Y` are a key
    - Both are keys, and their values are equal.
    - `X` is a key, and `Y` is a string equal to the key's contents.
    - `Y` is a key, and `X` is a string equal to the key's contents.
  - If `X` or `Y` are lists
    - Both are empty.
    - Both have the same length, their `car`s are equal, and their `cdr`s
      are equal.
  - Otherwise, `X` and `Y` are equal if they are the same value.
- If `X` or `Y` do not exist
  - They are not equal if one exists and the other does not.
  - They are equal if neither exists.  

## `error!`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:60:1*

Throw an error.

## `(exists? x)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:64:1*

Check if `X` exists, i.e. it is not the special value `nil`.
Note that, in Urn, `nil` is not the empty list.

Exit the program with the exit code `CODE`, and optionally, print the
error message `REASON`.

## `(fail! x)`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:68:1*

without unwinding for an error handler.

## `(falsey? x)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:59:1*

Check whether `X` is falsey, that is, it is either `false` or does
not exist.

## `(filter p xs acc)`

'(2 4 6)
```

## `(flatten xss)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:306:1*

Concatenate all the lists in `XSS`. `XSS` must not contain elements which
are not lists.

Example:
```
> (flatten '((1 2) (3 4)))
'(1 2 3 4)
```

## `(foldr f z xs)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:87:1*

Accumulate the list `XS` using the binary function `F` and the zero element `Z`.
This function is also called `reduce` by some authors. One can visualise
(foldr f z xs) as replacing the [`cons`](lib.base.md#cons-x-xs) operator in building lists with `F`,
and the empty list with `Z`.

Consider:
- `'(1 2 3)` is equivalent to `(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '())))`
- `(foldr + 0 '(1 2 3))` is equivalent to `(+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 0)))`.

Example:
```
> (foldr append '() '((1 2) (3 4)))
; equivalent to (append '(1 2) (append '(3 4) '()))
'(1 2 3 4)
```

## `(for ctr start end step &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:95:1*

by `STEP` every iteration until `CTR` is outside of the range given by
[`START` .. `END`]

## `(for-each var lst &body)`

2
3
nil
```

## `(for-pairs vars tbl &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/table.lisp:110:1*

Return the value `X` unmodified.

## `(if c t b)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:59:1*

Evaluate `T` if `C` is true, otherwise, evaluate `B`.

## `(inc! x)`
*Macro defined at lib/prelude.lisp:28:1*

Increment the variable `X` in place.

## `(invokable? x)`
*Defined at lib/function.lisp:82:1*

Test if the expression `X` makes sense as something that can be applied to a set
of arguments.

### Example
```
> (invokable? invokable?)
true
> (invokable? nil)
false
> (invokable? (setmetatable (empty-struct) (struct :__call (lambda (x) (print! "hello")))))
true
```

## `iter-pairs`
*Native defined at lib/lua/table.lisp:10:1*

Iterate over `TABLE` with a function `FUNC` of the form (lambda (`KEY` `VAL`) ...)

## `(key? x)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:40:1*

Check whether `X` is a key.

## `(keys st)`

Return the keys in the structure `ST`.

## `(last xs)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:204:1*

Return the last element of the list `XS`.
Counterintutively, this function runs in constant time.

Example:
```
> (last (range 1 100))
100
```

## `(let vars &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:45:1*

Bind several variables (given in `VARS`), then evaluate `BODY`.
In contrast to [`let*`](lib.binders.md#let-vars-body), variables bound with [`let`](lib.binders.md#let-vars-body) can not refer to
eachother.

### Example
```cl
(let [(foo 1)

  (+ foo bar))
```

## `(let* vars &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:23:1*

       (bar (+ foo 1))]
  foo
```

## `(letrec vars &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:122:1*

                       (or (= 0 n)
                           (is-odd? (pred n)))))
           (is-odd? (lambda (n)
                      (and (! (= 0 n))
                           (is-even? (pred n)))))]
    (is-odd? 11))
true
```

logical or of all the values in `REST`.

## `(pop-last! xs)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:244:1*

Mutate the list `XS`, removing and returning its last element.

Example:
```
> (define list '(1 2 3))
> (pop-last! list)
3

'(1 2)
```

## `(push-cdr! xs val)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:227:1*

Mutate the list `XS`, adding `VAL` to its end.

Example:
```
> (define list '(1 2 3))
> (push-cdr! list 4)
'(1 2 3 4)
> list
'(1 2 3 4)
```

## `(quasiquote val)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:224:1*

Quote `VAL`, but replacing all `unquote` and `unquote-splice` with their actual value.

Be warned, by using this you loose all macro hygiene. Variables may not be bound to their
expected values.

## `(range start end acc)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:317:1*

Build a list from `START` to `END`. This function is tail recursive, and
uses the parameter `ACC` as an accumulator.

Example:
```
> (range 1 10)
'(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
```

## `(remove-nth! li idx)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:261:1*

Mutate the list `LI`, removing the value at `IDX` and returning it.

Test whether `SYMB` is a slot. For this, it must be a symbol, whose contents
are `<>`.

## `(snoc xss &xs)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:75:1*

Return a copy of the list `XS` with the element `XS` added to its end.
This function runs in linear time over the two input lists: That is,
it runs in `O`(n+k) time proportional both to `(# XSS)` and `(# XS)`.

Example:
```
> (snoc '(1 2 3) 4 5 6)
'(1 2 3 4 5 6)
``` 

## `string->number`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:36:1*

Convert the string `X` into a number. Returns `nil` if it could not be parsed.

Optionally takes a `BASE` which the number is in (such as 16 for hexadecimal).

## `(string->symbol x)`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:56:1*

Convert the string `X` to a symbol.

## `(string/split text pattern limit)`
*Defined at lib/string.lisp:19:1*

Split the string given by `TEXT` in at most `LIMIT` components, which are
delineated by the Lua pattern `PATTERN`.

It is worth noting that an empty pattern (`""`) will split the string
into individual characters.

### Example
```
> (split "foo-bar-baz" "-")
("foo" "bar" "baz")
> (split "foo-bar-baz" "-" 1)
("foo" "bar-baz")
```

## `(string/trim str)`

Check whether `X` is a string.

## `(struct &keys)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:74:1*

Return the structure given by the list of pairs `KEYS`. Note that, in contrast
to variations of `LET`, the pairs are given "unpacked": Instead of invoking
```cl
(struct [(:foo bar)])
```
or
```cl
(struct {:foo bar})
```
you must instead invoke it like
```cl
(struct :foo bar)
```

## `(struct->assoc tbl)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:50:1*

Convert the structure `TBL` into an association list. Note that
`(eq? x (struct->assoc (assoc->struct x)))` is not guaranteed,
because duplicate elements will be removed.

## `(succ x)`

Check whether `X` is a symbol.

## `(table? x)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:7:1*

Check whether the value `X` is a table. This might be a structure,
a list, an associative list, a quoted key, or a quoted symbol.

## `(take xs n)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:55:1*

Take the first `N` elements of the list `XS`.

Example:
```
> (take '(1 2 3 4 5) 2)
'(1 2)
```

## `(traverse xs f)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:194:1*

An alias for [`map`](lib.list.md#map-f-xs-acc) with the arguments `XS` and `F` flipped.

## `(update-struct st &keys)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:134:1*

Create a new structure based of `ST`, setting the values given by the pairs in `KEYS`.

## `(values st)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:128:1*

Return the values in the structure `ST`.

## `(when c &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:63:1*

Evaluate `BODY` when `C` is true, otherwise, evaluate `nil`.

## `(when-let vars &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:60:1*

Bind `VARS`, as with [`let`](lib.binders.md#let-vars-body), and check they are all truthy before evaluating
`BODY`.
```cl
(when-let [(foo 1)
           (bar nil)]
  foo)
```
Does not evaluate `foo`, while
```
(when-let [(foo 1)
           (bar 2)]
  (+ foo bar))
```
does.

## `(when-let* vars &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:79:1*

Bind each pair of `(name value)` of `VARS`, checking if the value is truthy
before binding the next, and finally evaluating `BODY`. As with [`let*`](lib.binders.md#let-vars-body),
bindings inside [`when-let*`](lib.binders.md#when-let-vars-body) can refer to previously bound names.

### Example
```cl
(when-let* [(foo 1)
            (bar nil)
            (baz 2)
  (+ foo baz))
```
Since `1` is truthy, it is evaluated and bound to `foo`, however, since
`nil` is falsey, evaluation does not continue.

## `(when-with var &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:101:1*

Bind the `PAIR` var of the form `(name value)`, only evaluating `BODY` if the
value is truthy

### Example
```cl
(when-with (foo (get-idx bar :baz))
   (print! foo))
```
When `bar` has an index `baz`, it will be bound to `foo` and printed. If not,
the print statement will not be executed.

## `(while check &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:114:1*

Iterate `BODY` while the expression `CHECK` evaluates to `true`.

## `(with var &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:40:1*

Bind the single variable `VAR`, then evaluate `BODY`.

## `(zip fn &xss)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:362:1*

Iterate over all the successive cars of `XSS`, producing a single list
by applying `FN` to all of them. For example:

Example:
```
> (zip list '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) '(7 8 9))
'((1 4 7) (2 5 8) (3 6 9))
```
