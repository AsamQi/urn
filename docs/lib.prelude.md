## `(! expr)`
*Defined at lib/base.lisp:80:1*

Return the length of the string `X`.

## `(-> x &funcs)`
*Macro defined at lib/function.lisp:59:1*

Chain a series of method calls together. If the list contains `<>`
then the value is placed there, otherwise the expression is invoked with
the previous entry as an argument.

### Example
```
> (-> '(1 2 3)
    succ
    (* <> 2))
(4 6 8)
```

## `(.. &args)`

Concatenate the several values given in `ARGS`. They must all be strings.

## `(.<! x &keys value)`
*Macro defined at lib/table.lisp:66:1*

Set the value at `KEYS` in the structure `X` to `VALUE`.

## `(.> x &keys)`
*Macro defined at lib/table.lisp:60:1*

Index the structure `X` with the sequence of accesses given by `KEYS`.

## `(all p xs)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:58:1*

Test if all elements of `XS` match the predicate `P`.

## `(and a b &rest)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:131:1*

Test for the existence of any element in `XS` matching the predicate `P`.

## `(append xs ys)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:116:1*

Concatenate `XS` and `YS`.

## `arg`
*Defined at lib/base.lisp:169:1*

The arguments passed to the currently executing program

## `(assert-type! arg ty)`
*Macro defined at lib/type.lisp:137:1*

Assert that the argument `ARG` has type `TY`, as reported by the function
[`type`](lib.type.md#type-val).

## `(assoc list key or-val)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:10:1*

Return the value given by `KEY` in the association list `LIST`, or, in
the case that it does not exist, the value `OR`-`VAL`, which can be nil.

## `(assoc->struct list)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:35:1*

Convert the association list `LIST` into a structure. Much like [`assoc`](lib.table.md#assoc-list-key-or-val),
in the case there are several values bound to the same key, the first
value is chosen.

## `(assoc? list key)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:21:1*

Check that `KEY` is bound in the association list `LIST`.

## `(atom? x)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:46:1*

- `A` boolean
- `A` string
- `A` number
- `A` symbol
- `A` key
- `A` function

## `(between? val min max)`

Drop the first element of the array `X`, and return the rest.

## `(compose f g)`
*Defined at lib/function.lisp:100:1*

Return the pointwise composition of functions `F` and `G`. This corresponds to
the mathematical operator `âˆ˜`, i.e. `(compose f g)` corresponds to
`h(x) = f (g x)` (`(lambda (x) (f (g x)))`).

## `(cons x xs)`
*Defined at lib/base.lisp:53:1*

Add `X` to the start of the list `XS`. Note: this is linear in time.

## `(cons->pair x)`
*Defined at lib/pair.lisp:22:1*

Convert the cons structure `X` into a pair, where [`cons`](lib.base.md#cons-x-xs)es have been replaced
by applications of [`pair`](lib.pair.md#pair-x-y). Aditionally, it holds that
  `(eq? (car x) (fst (cons->pair x)))`
and
  `(eq? (cdr x) (snd (cons->pair x)))`

## `(const x)`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:82:1*

Return a function which always returns `X`. This is equivalent to the `K`
combinator in `SK` combinator calculus.

## `(cut &func)`
*Macro defined at lib/function.lisp:16:1*

Partially apply a function `FUNC`, where each `<>` is replaced by an
argument to a function. Values are evaluated every time the resulting
function is called.

### Example

6
```

## `(cute &func)`
*Macro defined at lib/function.lisp:37:1*

Partially apply a function `FUNC`, where each `<>` is replaced by an
argument to a function. Values are evaluated when this function is
defined.

### Example
```
> (define double (cute * <> 2))
> (double 3)
6
```

## `(debug x)`
*Defined at lib/base.lisp:143:1*

## `(empty-struct? xs)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:100:1*

## `(eq? x y)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:84:1*

Rules:
- If `X` and `Y` exist, `X` and `Y` are equal if:
  - If `X` or `Y` are a symbol
    - Both are symbols, and their contents are equal.
    - `X` is a symbol, and `Y` is a string equal to the symbol's contents.
    - `Y` is a symbol, and `X` is a string equal to the symbol's contents.
  - If `X` or `Y` are a key
    - Both are keys, and their values are equal.
    - `X` is a key, and `Y` is a string equal to the key's contents.
    - `Y` is a key, and `X` is a string equal to the key's contents.
  - If `X` or `Y` are a pair
    - `X` and `Y` are equal if both their `fst` are equal (according to `eq?`)
      and their `snd` are equal.
  - If `X` or `Y` are lists
    - Both are empty.
    - Both have the same length, their `car`s are equal, and their `cdr`s
      are equal.
  - Otherwise, `X` and `Y` are equal if they are the same value.
- If `X` or `Y` do not exist
  - They are not equal if one exists and the other does not.
  - They are equal if neither exists.

not exist.

## `(filter p xs acc)`

Filter the list `XS` using the predicate `P`. The parameter `ACC` is for internal use only.

## `(flatten xss)`

of arguments.

### Example

Check whether `X` is a key.

## `(last xs)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:78:1*

## `(let vars &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:22:1*

Bind several variables (given in `VARS`), then evaluate `BODY`.
In contrast to [`let*`](lib.binders.md#let-vars-body), variables bound with [`let`](lib.binders.md#let-vars-body) can not refer to
eachother.

### Example
```cl
(let [(foo 1)

  (+ foo bar))
```

## `(let* vars &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:6:1*

                           (is-odd? (pred n)))))
           (is-odd? (lambda (n)
                      (and (! (= 0 n))
                           (is-even? (pred n)))))]
    (is-odd? 11))
true
```

Compare `X` and `Y` for inequality deeply. `X` and `Y` are `neq?`
if `([[eq?]] x y)` is falsey.

## `(nil? x)`

logical or of all the values in `REST`.

## `(pair x y)`
*Defined at lib/pair.lisp:5:1*

Build a pair out of the values `X` and `Y`. `X` and `Y` must both `exist?`,
otherwise an invalid pair will be produced.

## `(pair->cons x)`
*Defined at lib/pair.lisp:32:1*

The opposite of [`cons->pair`](lib.pair.md#cons-pair-x), building a [`cons`](lib.base.md#cons-x-xs) structure out of the
(possibly nested) pair `X`. Conversely, it holds that
  `(eq? (fst x) (cdr (pair->cons x)))`
and
  `(eq? (snd x) (car (pair->cons x)))`

## `(pair? x)`
*Defined at lib/pair.lisp:43:1*

Mutate the list `XS`, adding `VAL` to its end.

## `(range start end acc)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:126:1*

Build a list from `START` to `END`. This function is tail recursive, and uses the parameter `ACC` as an accumulator.

## `(remove-nth! li idx)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:102:1*

Mutate the list `LI`, removing the value at `IDX` and returning it.

## `(reverse xs acc)`
*Defined at lib/list.lisp:133:1*

Reverse the list `XS`, using the accumulator `ACC`.

## `(self x key &args)`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:87:1*

Index `X` with `KEY` and invoke the resulting function with `X` and `ARGS`

## `(slot? symb)`

Extract the second component of the pair `X`.

## `string->number`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:34:1*

Optionally takes a `BASE` which the number is in (such as 16 for hexadecimal).

## `(string->symbol x)`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:54:1*

Convert the string `X` to a symbol.

## `(string? x)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:22:1*

Check whether `X` is a string.

## `(struct &keys)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:74:1*

Return the structure given by the list of pairs `XS`. Note that, in contrast
to variations of `LET`, the pairs are given "unpacked": Instead of invoking
```cl
(struct [(:foo bar)])
```
or
```cl
(struct {:foo bar})
```
you must instead invoke it like
```cl
(struct :foo bar)
```

## `(struct->assoc tbl)`
*Defined at lib/table.lisp:50:1*

Convert the structure `TBL` into an association list. Note that
`(eq? x (struct->assoc (assoc->struct x)))` is not guaranteed,
because duplicate elements will be removed.

## `(succ x)`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:18:1*

Return the successor of the number `X`.

## `(symbol->string x)`
*Defined at lib/prelude.lisp:48:1*

Convert the symbol `X` to a string.

## `(symbol? x)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:30:1*

Check whether `X` is a symbol.

## `(table? x)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:9:1*

Check whether the value `X` is a table. This might be a structure,
a list, an associative list, a quoted key, or a quoted symbol.

## `(traverse xs f)`

An alias for [`map`](lib.list.md#map-f-xs-acc) with the arguments `XS` and `F` flipped.

## `(type val)`
*Defined at lib/type.lisp:76:1*

Return the type of `VAL`.

## `(unless c &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:69:1*

Evaluate `BODY` if `C` is false, otherwise, evaluate `nil`.

## `(when c &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:65:1*

Evaluate `BODY` when `C` is true, otherwise, evaluate `nil`.

## `(when-let vars &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:35:1*

Bind `VARS`, as with [`let`](lib.binders.md#let-vars-body), and check they are all truthy before evaluating
`BODY`.
```cl
(when-let [(foo 1)
           (bar nil)]
  foo)
```
Does not evaluate `foo`, while
```
(when-let [(foo 1)
           (bar 2)]
  (+ foo bar))
```
does.

## `(when-let* vars &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:53:1*

Bind each pair of `(name value)` of `VARS`, checking if the value is truthy
before binding the next, and finally evaluating `BODY`. As with [`let*`](lib.binders.md#let-vars-body),
bindings inside [`when-let*`](lib.binders.md#when-let-vars-body) can refer to previously bound names.

### Example
```cl
(when-let* [(foo 1)
            (bar nil)
            (baz 2)
  (+ foo baz))
```
Since `1` is truthy, it is evaluated and bound to `foo`, however, since
`nil` is falsey, evaluation does not continue.

## `(when-with var &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/binders.lisp:75:1*

Bind the `PAIR` var of the form `(name value)`, only evaluating `BODY` if the
value is truthy

### Example
```cl
(when-with (foo (get-idx bar :baz))
   (print! foo))
```
When `bar` has an index `baz`, it will be bound to `foo` and printed. If not,
the print statement will not be executed.

## `(while check &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:116:1*

Iterate `BODY` while the expression `CHECK` evaluates to `true`.

## `(with var &body)`
*Macro defined at lib/base.lisp:127:1*

Bind the single variable `VAR`, then evaluate `BODY`.
